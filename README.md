**Wrocław city bike** gives an opportunity to rent a bike and ride around the town. Our aim in this project is to predict a number of bikes available in the station to make bike trips planning easier.

We used bikes rental history data set from *www.wroclaw.pl/open-data/* and weather data (i.e. temperature, air humidity and wind speed) collected by Polish Institute of Meteorology and Water Management.

The best results we obtained with Random Forests. We are able to predict a number of available bikes with accuracy of 75% (on a test set) and whether at least one bike will be available with accuracy of 97% (on a test set).

This project was being developed at the beginning of Covid-19 pandemic, so it probably should be slightly modified to be used today.
