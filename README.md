**Wrocław city bike** gives an opportunity to rent a bike and ride around the town. Our aim in this project is to predict a number of bikes available in the station to make bike trips planning easier.

We used bikes rental history data set from *www.wroclaw.pl/open-data/* and weather data (i.e. temperature, air humidity and wind speed) collected by Polish Institute of Meteorology and Water Management.
